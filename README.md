@twipped/utils
===

A collection of basic utility functions that I use in many of my rollup/react projects instead of lodash. No, it's not documented.

### Usage

```
npm install @twipped/utils
```

### Usage

In CommonJS:

```js
const u = require('@twipped/utils');
```

In ES6:

```js
import * as u from '@twipped/utils';
```
